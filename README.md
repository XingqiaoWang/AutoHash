# AutoHash

The current release includes our trained hashing model, all datasets, and the experiment script necessary to reproduce our results. However, the full source code is part of a commercialization effort and is currently the subject of a pending patent application. Due to intellectual property considerations, we are unable to publicly release the source code at this time. We are committed to making all supplementary materials, including the source code, publicly available as soon as commercialization and patent protection are granted.
