# AutoHash: Autoencoder-Based Compact Hashing for Scalable k-NN Search in Vector Databases

## Notes
The current release includes our trained hashing model, all datasets, and the experiment script necessary to reproduce our results. However, the full source code is part of a commercialization effort and is currently the subject of a pending patent application. Due to intellectual property considerations, we are unable to publicly release the source code at this time. We are committed to making all supplementary materials, including the source code, publicly available as soon as commercialization and patent protection are granted.
# AutoHash: Visualization and Data

## Overview
This repository provides essential supplementary materials for the AutoHash project, including:

- **Visualization Notebook:** The Jupyter notebook (`visualization.pynb`) used to generate all figures presented in our study.
- **Training Dataset:** Full training dataset available for reproducing the experiments.

## Contents
- [`visualization.pynb`](visualization.pynb): Jupyter notebook with step-by-step procedures for reproducing all figures from our research.
- **Dataset:** [Download Training Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p09OFWosYdZy9dIpE-syiH2hhCaN2h7V?usp=sharing)

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. **Download the training dataset:**
   - [Training dataset link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p09OFWosYdZy9dIpE-syiH2hhCaN2h7V?usp=sharing)
   - Place the dataset within the cloned repository directory for easy access.

3. **Run the Visualization Notebook:**
   - Open `visualization.pynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook visualization.pynb
   ```
   - Follow notebook instructions to generate figures.


- The full source code for AutoHash remains pending due to patent and commercialization efforts. It will be made publicly available upon completion of these processes.
